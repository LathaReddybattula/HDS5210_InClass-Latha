Your data files are empty. I get a sense of what would have been in them.
You created functions above to calculate Risk and Score, but then you didn't actually call them from your main business logic, instead choosing to implement dummy functions.
Your Dyspnea normalization doesn't take into consideration the actual data in the file, so your functions would have initially thrown errors.
You didn't actually call DocTest, but instead implemented unit tests. I haven't taught you unit tests...
